Hi, I'm @Enucatl. I'm interested in programming, data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence.

I organized my older repositories in separate organizations:

- [enucatl-phd](https://github.com/orgs/enucatl-phd/repositories) for code, papers and the thesis I wrote during my PhD in X-ray physics (2013-2018)
- [enucatl-presentations](https://github.com/orgs/enucatl-presentations/repositories) for the public presentations of my PhD work
- [enucatl-university](https://github.com/orgs/enucatl-university/repositories) for code, papers and theses written while studying Physics at the University of Padua (2007-2012)
- [galilean-traders](https://github.com/orgs/galilean-traders/repositories) for an automated cryptocurrency trading bot
- [esami-galileiani](https://github.com/orgs/esami-galileiani/repositories) a book with physics and maths to prepare for college admission
